# Better Vibe Coding

Improve your vibe coding skills by following these rules:

A lot of rules apply to humans and LLMs.

## Before you start your new project
- Define the data model in a conversation with an LLM (Claude works pretty well)
- Choose a good tech stack

## During implementation
- Write high-level unit, integration, and acceptance tests (or let the AI write them for you)
- Break down features to smaller tasks
- Refactor
